# Event-Finder

This is an app that lets you pick your preferred activities and then recommends things for you o do in London. 
You can then save the events you want on your calendar or book them through the Eventbrite website.

This app is using Eventbrite's API for the events, as well as the Full Calendar API and the Google Maps API for the calendar view of your events.

The back end of this application was done using Ruby on Rails, and the front end is using React. 
The design is a combination of MDBoostrap, independent npm packages and pure CSS.
